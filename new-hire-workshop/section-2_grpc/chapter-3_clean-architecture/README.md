* Collate other services that use Clean Arch as examples.

* Should this section give brief description on the layers or should we just point to elsewhere? i.e. go chapter guide, clean coder blog, etc.

### Entities/Domain
### Usecases
### Adapters
### Infrastructure/Drivers

## Exercise: Create Entities/Domain

* These sections should be similar in format and goal.
